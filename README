The idea behind this project is to build a simple PHP app that gets update hooks from
GitHub and then publishes files from that project to S3 using the AWS SDK

Set your GitHub Service Hook to push to the index.php
Check the GitHub project you want to update to S3 out in this directory using the default name
Set up a cron to run relay.php on a regular basis to fetch updates out of SQS and push the code to S3
